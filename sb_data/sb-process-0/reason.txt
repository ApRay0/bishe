( 1 ) Increase the confidence Level of failure analysis (power supply RAM, ADC converter)
( 2 ) Prevent ACM damage. Linked to excessive ice build-up, by temporary increase of water extractor temperature sensor demand in order to de-ice the pipes downstream the turbine
( 3 ) Prevent ACM rotation (windmiLLing ) when the flow control valve is closed while the pack secondary controllers are controlling the Ram A ir inlet door
( 4) Prevent APU cycling when the flow control valve setting is selected to 80 7. during take off and Landing.
Numerous pack faults and overheating have been reported on Low life operation air conditioning packs. Shop examinations have highlighted that air cycle machines failures were due to fan wheel damage and bearing seizure.
( 1 ) Increase the confidence Level of failure detection and improve the ECAM flow indication stability
( 2 ) Ease the ACM behaviour (3) Prevent unjustified detection failures :
( a ) FCV stepper motor incorrect answer.
( b ) Water extractor temperature sensor failure detection when temperature reaches 1109 C
( c ) Erroneous primary and secondary measurement comparison.
( 4 ) ACM wind millin g when the FCV is closed during flight .
(5) Modify flow indication filtering to avoid ECAM indication fluctuation.

This Service Bulletin is published to advise A320 operators of BAVARIA AVIONIK TECHNOLOGIE Service Bulletin NO. 600615-21-001. This publication deals with the replacement of the cargo vent controller, which wil l prevent possible erroneous cargo isolation valves closures which occur during start-up of the aircraft electrical system. Background is that after start-up the smoke detection control unit sends a short SMOKE signal to the cargo vent controller. If the cargo vent controller is powered up before the smoke detection control unit, this signal is Latched until the cargo vent controller is switched off and on again. A delay of the SMOKE latch by the cargo vent controller wil l eliminate this 
spurious warning.
The standard -5 outflow valve must be replaced after 1000 flight hours. To avoid subsequent replacement, a standard -4 outflow valve without flight hours Limitation can be installed by this Service Bulletin. Prevent projection of ice particles through the flight deck outlets. Whese ice chips are generated by the air conditioning packs and should be melted within the mixing unit. With existing system configuration some ice particles are not completely melted and can reach the flight deck air distribution outlets.
This Service Bulletin proposes the installation of a stopping grill at the outlet of the flight deck air conditioning duct at FR34.
The existing flow control valves have shown poor maintainability due to difficult
access to the pneumatic sense Lines connected to the unit and the existing clearance between the LH valve and the support bracket of the pack pressure sensors.
The improvement consists of implementation of quick disconnect couplings between
new sense Lines and valves and relocation of the pressure sensors.
The pneumatic bleed valves have a higher Leak rate than the flow controL valve
standard -03 which Leads to a pressure build-up in the bleed system and then to
automatic bleed closure due to overpressure when the packs are selected "Off" .
Two holes are drilled in the butterfly of the new flow control valve standard -04
to allow a callibrated Leak thus avoiding a bleed system malfunction. The modification to fLow controL vaLve standard -04 wiL L be accomplished with Liebherr/ABGSemca Vendor Service Bulletin No. 751A-21-01.
